Hello, I am Huaizhi Qu (屈怀智). I am a final-year undergraduate majoring in computer science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research interest includes 3D vision, neural rendering and intersection of computer vision and computer graphics.

Now I am working on generalizable multitask NeRF under the supervision of [Yingyan (Celine) Lin](https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/pages/team.html). Previsouly I have also done research about application AI in systems, using GNN to predict GPU occupancy, under the supervision of [Gongzhong Sun](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~gzsun/).

You can find my CV here: [Huaizhi Qu's CV](../assets/Huaizhi_Qu_CV.pdf)
